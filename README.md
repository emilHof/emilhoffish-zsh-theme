## hoffish Theme

If the [agnoster](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme) theme and [fish](https://fishshell.com/) shell had a ZSH theme for a child.

## Requirements

In order for this theme to render correctly, you will need:

1. A [Powerline-patched font](https://gist.github.com/1595572).
2. The [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) plugin.
3. The [shrink-path](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/plugins/shrink-path/shrink-path.plugin.zsh) plugin.

In addition, just like with the agnoster theme using it on Mac OS X, [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/) over Terminal.app - is recommended.
